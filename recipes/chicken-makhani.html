    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken:</li>
        <p>In a small bowl, mix the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and coat them evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour so the flavors soak in. Overnight marination will give even better flavor.</p>
        
        <li>Cook the chicken:</li>
        <p>Heat a little oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook until it is about 80% done. The chicken will finish cooking in the sauce later, so don't overcook at this stage. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.</p>
        
        <li>Prepare the sauce base:</li>
        <p>In the same pan, heat butter and a little oil so the butter doesn't burn. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown. Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute until aromatic. Add the pureed tomato along with red chili powder, coriander, cumin, and turmeric powder. Cook this mixture on medium heat for about 8-10 minutes until the oil starts to separate; this step develops the deep, rich flavor.s step develops the deep, rich flavor.</p>
        
        <li>Blend for smoothness (optional):</li>
        <p>If you prefer a smooth, restaurant-style sauce, let the mixture cool slightly, blend it into a fine paste, and return it to the pan. This step gives the sauce a silky texture but can be skipped if you like it rustic.</p>
        
        <li>Finish the dish:</li>
        <p>Add the partially cooked chicken pieces into the sauce. Stir in the heavy cream, honey or sugar (if using), garam masala, and crushed kasuri methi. Let it simmer gently on low heat for 10-15 minutes, allowing the chicken to cook through and the flavors to meld beautifully.</p>
        
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <p>Garnish with a small knob of butter and freshly chopped coriander leaves. Serve hot with naan or steamed rice for a complete meal.</p>
