    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A fluffy, golden omelette packed with onions, tomatoes, chilies, and fresh herbs, perfect for a quick and delicious breakfast.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk (optional, for fluffiness)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 green chili, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Â¼ tsp black pepper or red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp butter or oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the egg mixture:</li>
        <p>Crack the eggs into a small bowl. Add milk (if using), salt, and black pepper or red chili powder. Whisk well until the eggs are slightly frothy; this helps make the omelette light and fluffy.</p>

        <li>Add the vegetables:</li>
        <p>Mix in the chopped onion, tomato, green chili (if using), and coriander leaves. Stir well so the vegetables are evenly distributed in the egg mixture.</p>
        
        <li>Heat the pan:</li>
        <p>Place a non-stick pan on medium heat and add butter or oil. Allow it to melt and spread evenly across the pan's surface.</p>

        <li>Cook the omelette:</li>
        <p>Pour the egg mixture into the pan and swirl it gently so it spreads evenly. Let it cook on medium heat until the edges start to set, then reduce the heat slightly.</p>

        <li>Fold and finish:</li>
        <p>When the top is almost cooked but still slightly moist, fold the omelette in half using a spatula. Cook for another 30-60 seconds until fully done but still soft inside.</p>      

        <li>Serve:</li>
        <p>Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve hot with toast, bread, or as is for a quick breakfast.</p>
    </ol>
