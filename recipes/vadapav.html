    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the potato filling:</li>
        <p>Heat oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add curry leaves (if using), green chili, and ginger-garlic paste. Sauté for a minute until fragrant. Add turmeric powder, then mashed potatoes and salt. Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes. Stir in chopped coriander leaves and let the mixture cool. Shape it into a small ball.</p>

        <li>Make the batter:</li>
        <p>In a bowl, mix gram flour, turmeric, red chili powder, and salt. Add water gradually to form a smooth, thick batter—thick enough to coat the potato balls well. For extra fluffiness, you can add a pinch of baking soda.</p>

        <li>Fry the vada:</li>
        <p>Heat oil in a deep pan over medium heat. Dip each potato ball into the batter, coat it evenly, and carefully drop it into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown on all sides. Remove and drain on paper towels.</p>

        <li>Prepare the pav:</li>
        <p>Slice the pav bun in the middle but don't cut all the way through. If you like, spread green chutney, tamarind chutney, or dry garlic chutney on the inside for added flavor.</p>

        <li>Assemble the vada pav:</li>
        <p>Place the hot vada inside the pav bun, press gently, and serve immediately. Traditionally, it's enjoyed with fried green chilies on the side.</p>
